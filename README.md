## About

This project is a CPU scheduling simulator, built with React and Next.js, designed to provide a hands-on experience for understanding how different CPU scheduling algorithms impact process execution. It's a valuable tool for students, educators, and developers looking to visualize scheduling concepts.

## Features

-   **Process Generation:** Easily generate a customizable number of processes with randomized arrival times and burst times.
-   **Algorithm Comparison:** Directly compare the performance of FIFO, SJF, STCF, Round Robin (RR), and Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) algorithms.
-   **Visual Gantt Charts:** Gain visual insights into process execution timelines with interactive Gantt charts.
-   **Detailed Process Tables:** Inspect comprehensive process information and results in clear, sortable tables.
-   **MLFQ Configuration:** Fine-tune the MLFQ algorithm by adjusting time quanta for each queue and the boost interval.
-   **Responsive User Interface:** Enjoy a seamless experience on various screen sizes.
